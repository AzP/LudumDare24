LUDUM DARE #24
==============

This software depends on the following packages:
CMake (http://www.cmake.com)
Irrlicht (http://irrlicht.sf.net)
SDL (http://www.libsdl.org)

Install and download those before trying anything.
After that is done, please run:
> cmake .
> make

Hopefully the compile will go well, and you can
find the executables under client/bin
